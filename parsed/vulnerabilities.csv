96982,0,Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol Version 1 Enabled (uncredentialed check),"The remote Windows host supports Server Message Block Protocol version 1 (SMBv1). Microsoft recommends that users discontinue the use of SMBv1 due to the lack of security features that were included in later SMB versions. Additionally, the Shadow Brokers group reportedly has an exploit that affects SMB; however, it is unknown if the exploit affects SMBv1 or another version. In response to this, US-CERT recommends that users disable SMBv1 per SMB best practices to mitigate these potential issues.","Disable SMBv1 according to the vendor instructions in Microsoft KB2696547.

24786,0,Nessus Windows Scan Not Performed with Admin Privileges,"The Nessus scanner testing the remote host has been given SMB credentials to log into the remote host, however these credentials do not have administrative privileges. 

Typically, when Nessus performs a patch audit, it logs into the remote host and reads the version of the DLLs on the remote host to determine if a given patch has been applied or not.  This is the method Microsoft recommends to determine if a patch has been applied. 

If your Nessus scanner does not have administrative privileges when doing a scan, then Nessus has to fall back to perform a patch audit through the registry which may lead to false positives (especially when using third-party patch auditing tools) or to false negatives (not all patches can be detected through the registry).",Reconfigure your scanner to use credentials with administrative privileges.,10.147.160.11,0,tcp
26917,0,Microsoft Windows SMB Registry : Nessus Cannot Access the Windows Registry,"It was not possible to connect to PIPE\winreg on the remote host.
